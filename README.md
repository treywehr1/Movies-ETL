# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
It was the purpose of this challenge to practice a complete ETL sequence on Kaggle's "The Movie Dataset". 
This data set was paired with mutliple other datasets to be cleaned, merged, and uploaded onto a PostgreSql DB. 
These cleaned and merged dataframes in Python using Pandas were uploaded into a PostgreSQL DB for further querying.
